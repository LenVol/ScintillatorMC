nProtons   = 1 # Number of particles per pencil beam
Energy     =  200 # Energy of the proton beam
Model      = XCAT ## Model of the phantom to simulate
CTPath     = /home/cacfek/ScintillatorMC/LungPhantom/Lung_1.root ## When using XCAT as model, this indicates which phase to use
Angle      =  0 ## Angle of rotation for CT
Thickness  = 30 ## Thickness of the simulation world to measure impact of tracker position. It will be overriden in the XCAT phantom to match the simulation world
ANumber    = 1 ## Atomic number of particles to simulate
NPB        = 100 ## Number of pencil beam in a single direction. Currently the pencil beam are staggered uniformly over the scintillator side (30cm) based on their number.
sigmaX_pos = 5 ## Standard deviation in X direction of the first gaussian in mm
sigmaY_pos = 5 ## Standard deviation in Y direction of the first gaussian in mm
sigma_AngX = 25 ## Divergence of the beam in mRad
sigma_AngY = 25 ## Divergence of the beam in mRad
